#Basic banking system
We are students of BCA (Artificial Intelligence & Data Science) and have developed a Basic Banking System using the C programming language. The main goal of our project is to simulate core banking operations through a menu-driven program that is simple, interactive, and user-friendly. The system allows users to: • Create new bank accounts • Deposit and withdraw money • Check account balances • View account details We are implementing file handling to store and retrieve user data, ensuring that account information and transaction history are saved permanently. Account details, such as account number, holder name, account type, balance, and transaction records, are written to files, enabling users to access their data even after the program is closed and reopened. To ensure clarity and maintainability, we follow a modular programming approach by creating separate header files for each major function—such as account creation, transactions, balance checking, and file operations. This enhances code readability, reuse, and debugging. The project can be extended to include features such as: • Loan interest calculation • Transaction history logs • User authentication/login system • Admin vs. user roles • Data export in CSV or other formats Through this project, we aim to deepen our understanding of C programming, file I/O, data structures, and real-world software design. It serves as a foundational step toward building more advanced financial and data-driven applications.
